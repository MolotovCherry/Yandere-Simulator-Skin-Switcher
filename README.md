# Yandere Simulator Skin Switcher
A simple app to easily switch between different texture skins.

Ordinarily, switching skins takes effort. Renaming files, deleting other files, making sure it's all good. This is tedious and annoying. So, this app is here to make that easy!

You can find such skins on DeviantArt for example.

# How to use

- Install python 3.8
- `pip install pyside2`
- ` python main.py`

If you want to build:
- `pip install cx_freeze`
- Run `build.bat`

**Unfortunately, the build system is currently broken**

Problems:
- cx_freeze wants to include the whole 300mb pyside2 directory. This is too much big for a distribution. I'll try to solve it some other time
