# Yandere Simulator Skin Switcher
A simple app to easily switch between different texture skins.

Ordinarily, switching skins takes effort. Renaming files, deleting other files, making sure it's all good. This is tedious and annoying. So, this app is here to make that easy!

You can find such skins on DeviantArt for example.
